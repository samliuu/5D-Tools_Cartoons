		<h2>Steven Universe</h2>
		<img src="images/steven.jpg">
		<p>Steven Quartz Universe is the titular main protagonist of the TV show of the same name and its epilogue series. He is the son of Greg Universe and Rose Quartz/Pink Diamond, the only known hybrid of a human and a Gem and the first Crystal Gem of human descent. As a result of his parentage, Steven is an extraordinarily unique being with innate powers beyond that of normal humans and Gems. While he was only a child, Steven steadily grew from a tag-along to the Crystal Gems into their unofficial leader thanks to his kind-hearted nature and resourcefulness. Steven is devoted to protecting humanity and helping those in need just as Rose Quartz did, and though her monumental legacy once forced Steven to live in her shadow he has since surpassed her by ending the authoritarian practices of the Great Diamond Authority and establishing peace across the galaxy. However, the consequences of Homeworld's mistakes continue to haunt Steven and those he cares about to his growing frustration. Additionally, as his friends and family continue to grow and start to go out into the world and beyond, Steven has begun to struggle with his own self-identity and what he wants to do with the rest of his life. According to Pearl and Vidalia, Steven takes after his parents. He is relatively short with a thick, stocky build. He has curly dark brown hair, dark brown eyebrows and full black irises which can sometimes have stars as pupils when he gets excited or optimistic. He wears a salmon-pink T-shirt with a gold star in the center of it. He also wears cuffed blue jeans and salmon-pink flip-flop sandals. His gemstone, a pink diamond he inherited from his mother is where his navel should be.</p>

		<h2>Pearl</h2>
		<img src="images/pearl.jpg">
		<p>Pearl is a member of the Crystal Gems. One of Rose Quartz's closest followers and her sole confidant, Pearl is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in their rebellion against the Gem Homeworld. Pearl would afterward protect the Earth over the next several millennia alongside her friends, while later teaching Steven the ways of Gems. Years later, Pearl is no longer suffering from issues of self-worth and finds her way, knowing she is herself. Though she is struck and her memories wiped by Spinel's Rejuvenator, she gets her memories back by remembering her independence and ability for self-actualization. Pearl has a slender, thin build, ivory skin, sky-blue eyes, a pointed nose, and thin lips. She is quite a tall Gem; towering over Amethyst, Ruby, Sapphire, Peridot, and Steven alike. She is nearly equal in height (with hair) to Garnet's chin. Her hair has a peach color and resembles a pixie-cut in the front, while in the back, her hair leads to a point. Pearl is usually drawn without eyelashes or pupils, although they have been seen in some close-ups. Pearl's gemstone is located in the middle of her forehead and has no facets.</p>

		<h2>Garnet</h2>
		<img src="images/garnet.jpg">
		<p>Garnet is the voluntarily permanent fusion of Ruby and Sapphire and the current de facto leader of the Crystal Gems. Garnet is one of the last surviving Gems on Earth who joined the Crystal Gems in the rebellion against the Gem Homeworld and afterward assisted her friends in protecting the Earth over the next few millennia. After Rose Quartz gave up her physical form to give birth to her son, Steven Universe, Garnet took over as the leader of the group. Years later, Garnet is still an extremely stable fusion, living a loving and peaceful life among the Crystal Gems and their uncorrupted allies. This life came under threat when Spinel returned and struck her with a Gem Rejuvenator, wiping her memories and separating Ruby and Sapphire. The two then fuse accidentally and are subsequently restored when she is reminded of the value of truth and love. Garnet is currently the second tallest of the remaining Crystal Gems and the fourth-shortest fusion. She has three eyes, which are usually hidden behind a visor. Her right eye is a medium ruby-red, her left a medium sapphire-blue, while the center third eye is a reddish-violet. Her gemstones are embedded in the palms of her hands. Like Ruby, she has a deep violet cube-shaped afro and a purplish-red skin tone, while her facial features more closely resemble Sapphire's.</p>

		<h2>Amethyst</h2>
		<img src="images/amethyst.jpg">
		<p>Amethyst (specifically Amethyst Facet-5 Cut-8XM) is a member of the Crystal Gems. She is the last known Gem manufactured on Earth as a part of the Gem Homeworld's Kindergarten project, being one of the last surviving Gems on Earth. After being found by Rose Quartz and the other Crystal Gems, Amethyst helped her friends protect the Earth over the next four millennia, and often aids in the shenanigans of Steven Universe. Years later, Amethyst lives a peaceful life with the Crystal Gems, no longer struggling with low self-esteem. Though she was struck by a Gem Rejuvenator during Spinel's return and had her memory wiped, Amethyst was eventually restored by Steven, who helps her recall her fondness for him and her team through past experiences on Earth. Amethyst has a somewhat stout build common to Quartz Gems and is shorter than most of the characters, formerly rivaling Steven's height, though only by a couple of inches. She is about half the height of a "standard" Quartz Gem soldier, such as Jasper, due to remaining in the ground for an extra 500 years, which also gives her a somewhat overweight appearance. Her skin is bright lilac, her eyes are dark indigo, and her thick, messy hair is pale lavender and goes down to her ankles, with a large bang that obscures her left eye. She also has plump lips, and a small, upturned nose. Her gemstone is located on her chest, and the bottom half of it was usually covered by her shirt.</p>

		<h2>Connie Maheswaran</h2>
		<img src="images/connie.jpg">
		<p>Connie Maheswaran is Steven Universe's best friend and a member of the Crystal Gems who debuted in the episode "Bubble Buddies". After meeting Steven, she slowly began to learn about him, the Gems, and their past. Growing a strong bond with them, Connie decided that she wanted to help him and the Crystal Gems whenever danger arose in the Earth, training how to fight using a sword with Pearl since "Sworn to the Sword". She eventually becomes a skilled combatant and often aids the Gems during times of conflict. Connie is a young Indian-American girl with dark brown skin and, a slim figure, and is slightly taller than Steven. She has a prominent nose with black eyes with thick eyebrows, and has dark brown puffy hair.</p>

		<h2>Greg Universe</h2>
		<img src="images/greg.jpg">
		<p>Gregory "Greg" Universe (born Gregory DeMayo) is the father of Steven Universe and was the romantic partner of the now-deceased Rose Quartz. He is the current owner of It's a Wash. Greg appears as a plump middle-aged man with a dark-beige beard surrounding his mouth. Greg has a tan line on his shoulders and feet (possibly from a shirt and pants he wore before) and bushy taupe eyebrows. Greg's skin color is a peachy red color, with the tan line spots being a light apricot color, and dark brown hair with a large bald spot on the top of his head.</p>

		<h2>Lion</h2>
		<img src="images/lion.jpg">
		<p>Lion is a magical pink lion befriended by Steven that occasionally assists the Crystal Gems. Once a normal lion (presumably owned by Rose Quartz/Pink Diamond in the Desert hundreds of years ago), Lion eventually died through unknown means. Rose Quartz was able to resurrect Lion through her healing powers, giving Lion pink fur and magical abilities. After being entrusted with many of Rose's belongings, Lion roamed the Desert alone following Rose's departure until eventually being found by Steven. Lion has round ears, pink fur, black eyes, a soft light pink star-shaped mane, and a dark brownish-magenta heart-shaped nose. When Lion uses his magical abilities, his eyes and mane emit a white glow. There is a tuft of soft pink fur at the end of his thin tail.</p>

		<h2>Rose Quartz</h2>
		<img src="images/rose.jpg">
		<p>Rose Quartz, or Rose for short, was the founder and former leader of the Crystal Gems. Enthralled by the beauty of Earth, she led her friends and allies in a rebellion against the Gem Homeworld around 5,500 years before the events of the series successfully driving invading Gems off the planet and saving the life forms inhabiting it. Unbeknownst to others her identity as Rose Quartz was a facade to hide her true identity as Pink Diamond, only entrusting Pearl with the truth until its revelation thousands of years later. Rose later developed a romantic relationship with the human Greg Universe before giving up her physical form to give birth to their son Steven who inherited her gemstone. She is now a part of Steven. Rose Quartz was taller and had a heavier build than the other Crystal Gems standing at eight feet like Garnet and the Amethysts from the Prime Kindergarten (as seen in "Now We're Only Falling Apart"). She had bright-peach skin, defined lips with a pale pink color, bright black eyes and long curly pink hair styled in thick tubed ringlets. Her gemstone was located where a human navel is.</p>
